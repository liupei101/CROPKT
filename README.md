**Abstract**: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm where one cancer corresponds to one model. However, it naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot utilize the knowledge of other cancers. Although a multi-task learning-like framework has been studied recently, it usually has high demands on computational resources and needs considerable costs in iterative training on ultra-large multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper makes a paradigm shift to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on **cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs**, called **CROPKT**. It has three major parts: (*i*) we curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors); (*ii*) beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmark, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of transferability; (*iii*) we further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. We hope CROPKT could serve as an inception and lay the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Running Code

### Pre-requisites

All experiments are run on a machine with
- two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs
- python 3.8 and pytorch==1.11.0+cu113

Detailed package requirements:
- for `pip` or `conda` users, full requirements are provided in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/liupei101/CROPKT/blob/main/requirements.txt).
- for `Docker` users, you could use our base Docker image via `docker pull yuukilp/deepath:py38-torch1.11.0-cuda11.3-cudnn8-devel` and then install additional essential python packages (see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/liupei101/CROPKT/blob/main/requirements.txt)) in the container.

### Training Models 

Use the following command to load a experimental configuration and then train & evaluate a survival model (based on 5-fold cross-validation):
```bash
python3 main.py --config config/cfg_sa_base_uni2h_stl_moe_pkt.yaml --handler SAT --multi_run
```

All important configurations are explained in `config/cfg_sa_base_uni2h_stl_moe_pkt.yaml`. 

For training & evaluating traditional cancer-specific survival models, use the following:
```bash
python3 main.py --config config/cfg_sa_base_uni2h_stl.yaml --handler SA --multi_run
```
